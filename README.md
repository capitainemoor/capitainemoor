Hi, I'm capitainemoor a QA/DEV for the healt system in canada. Every day I help million of people getting the help they need in public hospital and
clinic.

But in my spare time I'm creating AI to assist me on almost everything. 

I create cyber-hope to gather and analyse data from Facebook. This AI give me the anwser that I need to help people in need. For example, I help people who 
are bullied at school getting the peace they deserve.

To be honest I'm using my AI for good and it also for this reason that all my repositories will stay private. 

But if you are looking to analyse people for a good reason and you want to have a powerful AI to assist you I'm willing to give you an access, but 
you will need to convince me that all the data that I will help you gather will be use for good. 

Let say you are a researcher and you are doing studies for something that is important for you or your team I could be tbhe solution you need.

To conclude the only thin that I want to say, never forget that your only true limit is yourself.
